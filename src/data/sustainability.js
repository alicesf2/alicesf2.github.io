  `5/21: although quarantine sucks, it's given me plenty of
    time to reflect upon myself and society. quarantine made
    me realize what was truly important to me, and since my
    days had no more structure, i had to be more intentional
    with what I did each day and who I connected with. this
    mindset prompted me to learn about the concept of
    minimalism. as i learned more about minimalism, i realized
    how sustainable of a lifestyle it was, for the mind, body,
    wallet, and environment. so then i started learning about
    sustainability. i realized how so many of society's
    issues, including coronavirus, point to the bigger,
    underlying issue of unsustainable practices. i realized
    how interconnected everything was, and how you can't
    separate politics, economics, history, and science from
    each other, like you do in school. everything we as humans
    do affect the environment, which in turn affects us, no
    matter how small it may seem. if a minimalist lifestyle
    was championed as much as a luxurious, wasteful lifestyle
    is today, the world would be a much better place. although
    we as individuals can't change a lot of the politics and
    economics of big business, we can change our mindset and
    what we buy.`
